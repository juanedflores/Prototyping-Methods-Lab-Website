## Week 1, Day 2 - What is New Media?
<!-- .slide: class=".uk-width-1-1 uk-height-large" -->  

Note: We are going to talk about the origin of New Media Art.  
- New Media art includes work that is designed and produced by means of `electronic media` technologies.
This includes:
    - virtual art
    - computer graphics
    - computer animation
    - digital art
    - interactive art
    - sound art
    - Internet art
    - video games
    - robotics
    - 3D printing/fabrication
    - immersive installation
    - cyborgs

#### Origins of New Media Art: The Military-Industrial Complex
<!-- .slide: class=".uk-width-1-1" -->  

The history of digital art is intertwined with the history of science and technology. The computer was born in an academic and research environment.

#### As We May Think by Vannevar Bush

Note: An essay written in 1945. Had a profound influence on the history of computing. It described a device called the Memex, a desk with screens that would allow users to browse documents and create their own "trail" through a body of documentation. All your contents, books, images, periodicals, could be purchased on microfilm, to be inserted and stored in the Memex. Direct data entry and retrieval. A year later (1946), the University of Pennsylvania presented the world's first digital computer.

Note: An essay written in 1945. Had a profound influence on the history of computing.

A year later (1946), the University of Pennsylvania presented the world's first digital computer.

Before ENIAC’s time, 'computers' referred to the people who worked on complex math equations. During World War II, computers relied on “function tables,” detailed information used to predict a shell’s path using metrics like air density, temperature, and wind, to calculate one part of a ballistics equation that would then be completed by a team of computers.

#### The emergence of the science of "Cybernetics" (1940s-)
<!-- .slide: class=".uk-width-1-1" -->  

<p style="font-size: 24px">
The science of control and communication between living things and machines.
</p>

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norbert_Wiener" target="_blank">
<img width="300px" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/56/Norbert_Wiener.png" alt="">
</a>

Note: Wiener is credited as being one of the first to theorize that all intelligent behaviour was the result of feedback mechanisms. Important step in "artificial intelligence".
This is also where ideas of the cyborg come in.

The Ancient Greek term κυβερνητικός (kubernētikos, '(good at) steering') appears in Plato's Republic[16] and Alcibiades, where the metaphor of a steersman is used to signify the governance of people.

#### Ted Nelson - Computer Lib / Dream Machine

</a>

Note: His book is on canvas. Ted Nelson is the founding designer of Xanadu, the world's first hypertext project. Ted has a vision for a free and open Internet. “Remember that things keep changing. The environment in which you become successful will be different from the environment in which you're starting.”

#### Ted Nelson - Coining the term "HyperText"

<img src="http://thedigitalage.pbworks.com/f/1258959102/Nelson_OrdHyperText.gif" alt="">
</a>

Note: Hypertext can be described as non-sequential writing.
By allowing students to learn through hyper-media, it puts them in control of their own learning. Every student has a different brain and a different way of learning that best suits them. enthusiasm and involvement are what really count. This is why the right to explore far outweighs any administrative advantages of creating and enforcing 'subjects' and curriculum sequences"

#### 9 Evenings: Theatre and Engineering (1966)
<!-- .slide: class=".uk-width-1-1" -->  


<p style="font-size:30px">10 artists and 30 engineers collaborated in one of the first large scale events dedicated to exploration between art & technology. (October 13-23, 1966)</p>

Note: As newer technologies rolled out, artists have always been among the first to reflect on the impact it has on the culture, while also figuring out unconventional ways to use them.

#### Computer Art
<!-- .slide: class=".uk-width-1-1" -->  

What is computable art? What is computation? What is a computer?

[Computer Art in the 50s and 60s Blog Post](https://www.amygoodchild.com/blog/computer-art-50s-and-60s)

Note: Art that is created, stored, and distributed via digital technologies and employs its features as its very own medium. By nature this is very hybrid, and constantly evolving.

#### Analogue Computers: Antikythera mechanism

<embed type="text/html" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/66/NAMA_Machine_d%27Anticyth%C3%A8re_1.jpg/440px-NAMA_Machine_d%27Anticyth%C3%A8re_1.jpg" width="500px">

Note: Discovered in 1901 in a wreck off the Greek island of Antikythera in the Mediterranean Sea. Exhibits the motions of the Sun, Moon, and the five planets known to the ancient Greeks. The ones that could be seen by the naked eye: Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. The word Planet comes from the Greek term "planetes", meaning "wanderer".

Used as a calculator the calculate astronomical positions.

#### Analogue Computers: Orrery

#### Analogue Computers: Tide Predictor

<img src="https://coimages.sciencemuseumgroup.org.uk/428/875/medium_smg00052155.jpg" alt="">

Note: The machine is a mechanical analogue computer which traces the tidal curve for a given location, by combining ten astronomical components. based on his application of harmonic analysis to tidal phenomena.

Knowledge of the tides is valuable not only for navigators, but also engineers building coastal structures, and fishermen working in shallow waters.

#### Telematic Art
<!-- .slide: class=".uk-width-1-1" -->  

"Telematic Art is a descriptive of art projects using computer-mediated telecommunications networks as their medium. Telematic art challenges the traditional relationship between active viewing subjects and passive art objects by creating interactive, behavioural contexts for remote aesthetic encounters."

#### Analog vs. Digital

An analog computer or analogue computer is a type of computation machine (computer) that uses the **continuous variation** aspect of physical phenomena such as electrical, mechanical, or hydraulic. These are known as analog "signals".

In a digital computer, information is stored as discrete values over time. (1s and 0s) This is a digital signal.
